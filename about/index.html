          <p>I have been developing software for 7 years using all sorts of technologies, so my skill set reflects that. I have also been for a long time interested in data visualization. That interest has led me to experiment with tools like Processing and D3.js and is responsible for my recent involvement with Machine Learning and Big Data.</p>
          <p>I recently completed the <a href={{site.data.links.coursera}}>Machine Learning course at Coursera</a> and my goal is to get more involved with that field and use the knowledge to help companies explore their data and bring value out of it.</p>

          <p>I absolutely love what I do! I think it's a great time to be into software development. there's so many different and interesting areas today, from machine learning to web development and from mobile applications to creative coding.</p>
          <p>It's challenging to keep up with the fast pace of software development and IT in general. that's why I spend a lot of time reading articles and newsletters, keeping up with the latest trends and overall expanding my knowledge and skills. It's the best way to get introduced to new things and technologies and it's responsible for a big part of my evolution as a software developer.</p>
