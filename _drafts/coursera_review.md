A review of Coursera's Machine Learning course
==============================================

I recently finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Coursera and thought a review of it would be a great way to kickstart this blog.

So the course runs for about 10 weeks, where each week there are 1-2 topics to study in the form of video lectures, review questions and a programming assignment.
They estimate 5 to 7 hours of work each week which I thought was quite acurate. Regarding prerequisites, I think basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus and software development is a great thing to have but not absolutely necessary.

Lectures
----------------------
Each week an average of 6 videos of 8-12min are released. I thought releasing the topics one at a time instead of everything from the start helps setting a pace and prevents binge watching, which is good because it lets all that information sink in. And the fact that each video is short and to the point makes it very easy to digest.

I found the lectures, as a whole, well structured since they start with a simple concept and keep building on that concept to form bigger and more complex concepts. I liked Andrew's teaching style because it felt very practical. He constantly uses examples to describe a problem and how a certain concept can solve that problem. That's a constant reminder why you're learning all this and how useful will be in the end. I found myself pausing the videos a couple of times making parallels between a particular problem-solution to my own ideas for side projects.

Review Questions
----------------
Could be more extensive
Questions change between atempts
There is always an explanation why the option is correct/wrong

Programming Exercises
---------------------
A lot is already given, you just have to fill up spaces
Comes down to several attempts of getting the equation right in octave
Needs more emphasis in better code quality
The exercise guide almost baby feeds you
Forum was a valuable resource for unit tests and to find better ways to implement the code in octave

Conclusion
