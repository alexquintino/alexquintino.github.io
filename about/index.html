      <p>I love what I do! I think it's a great time to be into software development. there's so many different and interesting areas today, from machine learning to web development to creative coding.</p>
      <p>that's why I spend a lot of time reading articles and newsletters, keeping up with the latest trends and overall expanding my knowledge and skills.</p>

    <p>the rest of my time is spent traveling, hiking, cycling and discovering music.</p>
