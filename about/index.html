  <p>My name is Alexandre Quintino and I'm a Software Engineer</p>

  <p>I come from Portugal where studied at IST and worked for Gatewit</p>
  <p>After that I moved to Stockholm to study at KTH and later work for Ongame</p>
  <p>Nowadays I'm based in Geneva where I work as a software consultant</p>

  <p>I love what I do! I think it's a great time to be into software development. There's so many different and interesting areas today, from machine learning to web development to creative coding.</p>
  <p>That's why I spend a lot of time reading reading articles and newsletters, keeping up with the latests trends and overall expanding my knowledge and skills</p>

  <p>The rest of my time is spent hiking, cycling, discovering music and traveling</p>
